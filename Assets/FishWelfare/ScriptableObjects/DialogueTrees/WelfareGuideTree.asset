    - 'To check the fish, grab them and place them on the table in between tanks. '
    - To check for gill disease, look for white spots or discoloration on the gills
      of the fish. Then rate the disease from 1 to 5, with a higher score meaning
      more discoloration.
    - To check for lice, look for brown spots on the skin of the fish. Count the
      amount of lice and log it.
