{
    /* ------------------ README ------------------
    
    This script is the main Game Manager for the simulation. It keeps track of the player's progress and the state of the simulation.
    The GameManager is a Singleton, meaning that only one instance of the GameManager can exist at any given time.
    The GameManager is also a MonoBehaviour, meaning that it should be attached to a GameObject in the Unity Editor. This exists as a prefab.
    The GameManager should be present in every scene, and should not be destroyed when loading a new scene to ensure persistence of the player's progress.
    The GameManager is connected to the AudioManager object in every scene to play sound effects. The AudioManager prefab should therefore be present in every scene.
    The GameManager will dynamically find the AudioManager object in the scene, as well as the game objects for the player's hands, to ensure that the player's gloves are set correctly.

    The GameManager is responsible for:
        - Keeping track of the player's progress
        - Playing sound effects
        - Setting the player's gloves based on the player's hand state
        - Setting the HSE room as completed when the player has put on ear protection, gloves, and boots
        - Toggling the room tasks to on and off
