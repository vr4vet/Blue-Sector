    - Hello and welcome! Thank you for trying the fish processing facility experience!
    - Before you can proceed to the bleeding station or the quality assurance room,
      you first need to make sure that you follow the health and safety guidelines.
    - You can start by washing your hands in the machine to the left of the gate.
      When you have done that you can come back to me for more info.

    - Once your hands are clean, it is important to wear proper gloves for the tasks
      ahead. In the bleeding station you are required to wear one steel glove on
      your non-dominant hand, and a regular blue one on the other.
    - Secondly, you need to ensure that your ears and feet are protected. I have
      prepared some equipment for you on the table ahead.
    - The shoes might be dirty so you need to wash them before putting them on.
