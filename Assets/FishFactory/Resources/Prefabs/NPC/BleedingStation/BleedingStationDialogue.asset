    - The fish on the conveyor belt are stunned and feel no pain. If a fish shows
      any signs of consciousness, it needs to be stunned before it is cut.
    - You can recognize conscious fish by their movement. Conscious fish will periodically
      flop on the conveyor belt.
    - "You will find a machine to the left of your station. Insert conscious fish
      into the machine with their head first, this will stun the fish. Afterwards,
      the stunned fish is ready to be cut.\r"
    - "Sometimes fish that are not fit for human consumption can come down the conveyor
      belt. Such inedible fish should be thrown in the basket next to the stun machine.\r"
