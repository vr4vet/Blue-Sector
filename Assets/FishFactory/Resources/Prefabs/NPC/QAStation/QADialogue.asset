    - Hello, and welcome to the quality assurance station. Your task here is to correctly
      sort fish by quality categories using the sorting machine.
    - The fish on the conveyour belt comes from a cooling tank where the fish bleeds
      out. Please step on the platform next to me to use the sorting machine.

    - So the sorting machine is made up of a button panel with 6 buttons on the front
      and a button on the side. Apart from the button panel there are four slots
      where the fish can be placed.
    - Which slot you place the fish in does not matter. You can use whatever slot
      is available  regardless of the quality of the fish. It's the buttons that
      are used to sort the fish.

    - There are a total of 7 buttons on the machine. The read button on the side
      starts and stops the conveyors. The conveyors are currently stopped so you
      need to press it before you start.
    - On the front there are six buttons with a number over each. The machine is
      designed to be used by two people and so each person has 3 buttons each. Therefore
      you only need to worry about the tree buttons closest to you.

    - 'The three buttons are used to electronically assign a tier to the fish that
      gets placed in the slots. As I said it does not matter which slot you put the
      fish in. '
    - 'The green button is for superior fish with no damages. The orange are for
      tier 2 with only minor damage. The blue button is for tier 3 fish with a lot
      of damage. '
    - There is no need to push a button for each fish. The machine remembers the
      last button that was pressed and has that as its active tier. When you want
      to sort a fish that does not belong in the active tier you simply press a different
      button to change the active tier.

    - Bad fish should not be placed in the sorting machine. They should instead be
      thrown into the square hole and will travel on the small belt.
    - After the fish is sorted, it is gutted by the machine on the other side of
      the room. There you will need to manually control the fish for incomplete guttings,
      or poor quality. My friend Geralt will help you when you feel finished here.
      He is waiting over by the gutting machine.
