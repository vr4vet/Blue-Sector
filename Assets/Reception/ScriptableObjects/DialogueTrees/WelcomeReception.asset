    - Welcome to Blue Sector! Here you have the opportunity to try out various work
      tasks within the maritime sector. Whether it's handling feeding responsibilities,
      factory duties, laboratory tasks or tasks on the fishing boat, we've got you
      covered.
    - I see you're ready to get started with your tasks. To handle the feeding, maintenance,
      and duties at the factory, you'll need to take the motorboat. It's docked right
      in front of the reception, just outside. Hop on and it will take you directly
      to your destination.
    - For the laboratory-related duties, you'll find the laboratory next door to
      the reception, just to the left. Head over there and touch the handle of the
      door to get inside.
