    m_Localized: Can cause significant damage to fish gills when found in excess
      number. The needle-like setae physically damage the fish gill lamellae. Fish
      farmers regularly have to take water samples to monitor the safe level and
      potentially harmful number. <i>Chaetoceros convolutes</i> found in excess of
      5000 cells/litre can be considered harmful to fish.
