    - Welcome to the Fish Laboratory. Here you will check the quality of the fish
      and its environment.
    - This will be done through multiple steps. First, you will have to measure a
      fish, then dissect it and check its indicators of health. You will then have
      to analyse algae content in a water sample.

    - The fish laboratory is important for gathering information on the health of
      the fish. This information is used to better regulate the feeding and treatment
      of the fish. By checking for any sickness or other health issues, information
      on the fish welfare can be obtained.
    - In the laboratory the condition factor of the fish is calculated. This is used
      to determine how well fed the fish is, and is important for regulating the
      feeding of the fish.
    - The fish is dissected to see if there are any issues, like sickness or damage.
    - The environmental conditions of the fish are also checked by analysing water
      samples with the microscope, as some plankton found in the water can be harmful
      to the fish.
