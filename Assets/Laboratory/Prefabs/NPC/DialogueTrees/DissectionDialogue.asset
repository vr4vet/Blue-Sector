    - ' Now you will dissect the salmon. Place it on the dissection board to the
      right of the length measuring board. The fish has been humanely culled.'
    - 'The next step is inspecting the internal areas of the salmon. Pick up the
      scalpel and cut open the fish according to the instructions of the superimposed
      arrows '
    - Now we need to expose the heart. Do so by cutting forwards according to the
      instructions.
    - Lastly, we need to expose the kidney. To do this, we need to open the swim
      bladder. Cut according to the instructions.

      question: Now that the salmon is dissected, we can learn what the different
        organs are called. Do so by pointing at them with your right hand. Try to
        remember what they are called, and tell me when you're ready.

      question: Great! I will now test your knowledge. I will highlight one of the
        salmon's organs and ask for the right name. I will provide three options,
        and you will have to pick the correct one.
