    - Now you are going to analyse a water sample in the microscope. Your goal is
      to look after different organisms in the sample, and count how many there are.
    - The sample is simplified for learning purposes. The slide only has 50 squares,
      and there's less than 50 plankton of each type. A typical slide could have
      1000 squares and a much higher plankton count.

      around.
    - Try to change the speed of how fast you move around by pressing plus or minus.
    - Zoom in or out by scrolling the nosepieces over the sample
    - On the left side of the microscope there is a counter. Grab it with your left
      hand and press the button on your index finger to count.
    - To reset the counter to zero press the top button on the counter.
