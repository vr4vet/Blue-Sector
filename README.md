## Development

### Standards

This project strives to follow the
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard
for commit messages. In an effort to make this specification more convenient to
follow, we include a gitmessage template.

To use this template, ensure you are in the root of the project and run the
command:

`git config commit.template .gitmessage`

This will set your local gitmessage template to the included file. If the -m
flag is used when issuing a commit the template will be ignored. It is also
worth mentioning that the project implements a commit message linter, which will
check your commit messages against the conventional commits standard when you
push to, or create a pull request against, the main or develop branches.

### Git LFS

Given that this is a unity project, it includes a lot of large texture, model,
and general media files. To speed up pushing, pulling, and development - as well
as saving storage - we utilise git LFS. Please ensure that you install the
[git LFS extension][lfs-install], and initiate it in your local repository with:

```sh
git lfs install
```

We have experienced reports of issues with LFS in the project.
If you get an error resembling:

"Encountered x files that should have been pointers,
but werent"

run these commands in order:

```sh
git lfs uninstall
git reset --hard
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

For a more complete explanation of LFS, see [here][lfs].

If you get the previous error when running "git reset --hard", then run these commands in order:

```sh
git rm --cached -r .
git reset --hard
git rm .gitattributes
git reset .
git checkout .
```
